											<h2>Who were the Templars?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											The Knights Templar was a Christian military order that was founded in 1119 by the French knight Hugues
											de Payens to protect those on pilgrimages to the Holy Land from Muslims in the lands they had to pass through
											to get there (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>). Initially,
											the order was named the <i>Poor Knights of the Temple of King Solomon</i>, after the location that their order was 
											operated out of, the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which was believed to be the ruins of Solomon's Temple (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar" 
											target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).
										</p>
										<header>
											<h2>A Rough Start</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											As aforementioned, the original name of the Knights Templar was the <i>Poor Knights of the Temple of King Solomon</i>. As the name 
											implies, the order was not very well funded in the first few years of it's existence. With the original nine members supposedly so 
											poor that they initally had only one horse (<a href="https://defendingcrusaderkingdoms.blogspot.com/2015/10/the-poor-knights-of-
											temple-of-solomon.html" target="_blank">Defending Crusader Kingdoms</a>). However, this changed once the order began to gain new
											members and gained endorsement from the church from Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, a strong advocate of the order (<a href="https://en.w
											ikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).
										</p>
										<header>
												<h2>Life in the Order</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Similarly to how monks have to follow specific rules in their daily lives, the members of the Knights Templar "lived by the same Rule as
											canons at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where they first found shelter," along with an additional 79 rules that were added at the 
											Council of Troyes (<a href="https://erenow.com/postclassical/the-real-history-behind-the-templars/10.html" target="_blank">Erenow</a>). 
											The final Rule that the Knights Templar became known as the <i><a href="http://www.templiers.org/regle1-eng.php" target="_blank">
											Latin Rule</a></i>. 
										</p>
										<p>
											The basics of a member's life in the Order included attending the citing of the monsatic hours, meeting once a week in Chapter to recieve 
											assignments and discipline, wearing specific clothing according to status and time of the year, along with being able to eat meat up to
											three times a week (<a href="https://erenow.com/postclassical/the-real-history-behind-the-templars/10.html" target="_blank">Erenow</a>).
